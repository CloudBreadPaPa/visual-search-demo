# Image Similarity Search 

Two quick POCs have been done using the [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) and [nmslib](https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib) libraries. 

According to the benchmarking done by [ann-benchmarks](http://ann-benchmarks.com/), which is a benchmarking environment for approximate nearest neighbor algorithms search, hnsw (faiss) and hnsw (nmslib) have some of the best performances from a speed and recall standpoint.
